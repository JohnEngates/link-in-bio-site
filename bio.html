    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-6 sm:mb-8 fade-in-delay">
      With over 30 years at the forefront of Internet innovation, John's journey began with launching one of Texas's first ISPs. He then served as CTO at Rackspace, where he helped pioneer cloud computing, and later as Client CTO at NTT Global Networks. Most recently, as Field CTO at Cloudflare, he guided global enterprises through their AI and security transformations. This deep expertise in scaling platforms and emerging technologies now fuels his independent research into the next frontier of AI.

      John continues to serve on the boards of a Texas-based bank and a manufacturing company while actively mentoring early-stage founders, particularly those working in AI and emerging technologies. His current research explores practical applications of multi-agent AI systems in solving complex real-world problems. He earned his degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio and splits his time between Texas and Colorado, where the diverse tech ecosystems and outdoor landscapes inspire his work. When not pushing the boundaries of AI, he enjoys mountain adventures and global travel with his wife and daughters.
