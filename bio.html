    <!-- Full Bio -->
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-4 fade-in-delay">
      <strong>John Engates</strong> is pioneering the future of artificial intelligence through his research on autonomous AI agents and multi-agent systems. After three decades at the forefront of distributed computing, from launching one of Texas's first ISPs to shaping the cloud infrastructure that powers today's Internet, John now explores how swarms of AI agents can collaborate to solve humanity's most complex challenges.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-4 fade-in-delay">
      As Field CTO at Cloudflare (2021-2025), John guided global enterprises through their AI and security transformations. Previously, as CTO at Rackspace for almost 18 years, he played a pivotal role in democratizing cloud computing. He helped bring "Fanatical Support" to life, building the culture and teams that set a new standard for customer service in tech. Under his leadership, Rackspace's Intensive Hosting division supported some of the Internet's most demanding workloads, including a little startup called YouTube.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-4 fade-in-delay">
      John's knack for seeing around corners led to founding moments in open source infrastructure. When Frank Frankovsky reached out via Facebook message about "open sourcing cloud computing hardware," John's immediate "yes" launched Rackspace's involvement in the Open Compute Project. He also led the RackLabs team that created the distributed storage system that became OpenStack Swift, now powering some of the largest storage platforms on Earth. That early Adobe demo validation? "Rough around the edges," they said, but it was enough to change the world.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-4 fade-in-delay">
      When Healthcare.gov crashed in 2013, John was among those called to the White House to help rescue the site that millions depended on. His testimony before Congress on cloud computing's strategic value helped shape public sector digital transformation. Throughout his career, he's been the translator between complex technology and business value, whether speaking at global conferences, advising boards, or mentoring the next generation through TechStars.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-4 fade-in-delay">
      Today, John serves on the boards of Frost Bank (NYSE: CFR) and James Avery Craftsman. Named UTSA Alumnus of the Year in 2014, he remains connected to his alma mater through the College of Sciences Advancement Council. An early-stage investor in cloud and SaaS startups, he continues to spot the technologies that will define tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-4 fade-in-delay">
      John splits his time between Texas (where he works) and Colorado (where he plays), finding inspiration in both the tech ecosystems and mountain landscapes. When not pushing the boundaries of AI, you'll find him off-roading, cycling, snowboarding, or capturing it all through his photography.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-600 text-left mb-6 sm:mb-8 fade-in-delay">
      His current research explores the emergent behaviors and collective intelligence that arise when AI agents work together: a natural evolution from decades spent building the distributed systems that connect our world.
